<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is dedicated to my master thesis, which focuses on predicting team performance from visual data. The objective of this research is to extract meaningful features such as emotions, engagement, and synchronization from individual team members using novel AI tools like RetinaFace, ByteTrack or FER. These features will then be used to calculate the PERMA score of the overall team and to determine if there is a correlation between the PERMA score and the team's performance.

PERMA is a metric that measures subjective happiness, and it is an essential part of this research. The overall goal is to increase the happiness of individuals and teams by better understanding the factors that contribute to happiness in a team setting.

Feel free to explore the repository and ask any questions or share ideas. Your feedback and collaboration are always welcome. I am looking forward to sharing my research with you and making a positive impact in the field of team dynamics.

If you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I am always open to feedback and suggestions.
